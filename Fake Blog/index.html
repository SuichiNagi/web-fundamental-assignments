    <p>Itsuki "Ikki" Minami is the main protagonist of the manga and anime Air Gear. Prior to the beginning of the series, he was established as the leader of his school's gang, the East Side Gunz. There, he earned the nickname Eastside's Greatest Babyface, which has followed him into the AT world, as his teammates occasionally refer to him as "Our Babyface". Ikki has shown an extreme amount of talent with the Air Treck, to the point of being a genius at it. It has been established that he, from a young age, always wanted to "fly" this fact being most notable when he climbed on his town's tallest monuments in a childish attempt to see everything. As said by Noyamano Rika, people believe that Ikki is "loved by the wind." Before he founded Kogarasumaru, the team that would become a leading icon in the AT world, he was riding with the emblem of Sleeping Forest. Eventually, he gave the emblem back to Ringo and went on to create Kogarasumaru. He is the leader of Kogarasumaru, originally composed of Kazu, Onigiri, Buccha and Agito/Akito/Lind and himself. He has been characterized as a crow, due to the baby crow that makes a nest of his hair, as a storm, as armoured multi-winged beast (this is noted to be his shadow when was the Wind King), and as a massive knight in black armor riding an equally gargantuan, armoured multi-winged beast (which is his current shadow), as the Storm King. Later, he is the current Sky King after defeating Sora Takeuchi.</p>

        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>Ikki is a very upbeat, zany person, who seemingly is as eccentric as just about everyone else in the universe of Air Gear . He delights in eating meat, a privilege he is often deprived of in the Noyamano household. He is rash, impulsive, and determined to do everything his way, whether for good or bad, in stark contrast to his friend Kazu who is calm, timid and more focused and prefers to stay in the background. In battle, Ikki either comes off as his ordinary crazy and unpredictable personality, or his more serious, cold and steely side, which other characters have described as a rare occurrence, and as an intimidating scene. Ikki is totally hooked onto Air Trekking. He treats his ATs with care to such a standard that even his sisters feel jealous of, and his mind is constantly on Air Trekking; for example, during the Kyoto trip he fails to notice Ringo's affection initially, deadset on figuring out a 'Windmill Theory' that another Storm Rider has revealed to him as the secret behind the Rumble King. Ikki is a self-proclaimed genius and is very proud of himself, in particular his fighting abilities. In truth, he works very hard behind the others' backs, as is revealed when Kuu brings his friends to his secret training area, where the scars left over by his training could be seen in chapter 87. Though his attitude can be described as a lowlife, suitable for his gangster-like persona, and though he likes to go around doing insanely foolish things all the time, Ikki has a tendency to think beyond others' perceivable concept and at several intervals can spout deep philosophy that more often than not will impact others. One such incident was the Pomtemkin brothers' battle, where Ikki's plan caused an initial falling out among the Kogarasumaru, where in fact he had his own solution around that matter. Ikki, though easy to miss the obvious, can be very adept when it comes to spotting small details. In their first Parts War, he alone had noticed that Kazu's ATs were the most worn out among them, a mark of how much he practiced.
        There are three main women who have feelings/interests for Ikki first one being Ringo who he had always considered a sister(not blood related) but changed after he battled with her and realized she has feelings for him, Simca she takes a huge interest into Ikki from the moment she met him, at one point wanted to become Ikki's tuner and finally Kururu who begins to develop feelings for Ikki this starting when he was hospitalized later she becomes Ikki's tuner. All three have feelings for him, although recently Ikki has shown signs of love towards Ringo.
        As noted by Sora, Ikki is a detailed oriented guy. Stating that Ikki is very calculating and could easily calculate a counter strike move after figuring out the enemy plans. According to Sora, Ikki had already calculated how to dodge his and Rikia's super move (e.g. God Crusher Gungnir.) and would done so had Ringo not got in the way and got hit. And after saving Ringo together they quickly countered a larger and more powerful God Crusher Gungnir even though their bodies were freezing due to the extremely cold atmosphere.
        Ikki is also known to have an unbreakable will. Even when the situation seems hopeless and pointless he never gives in or gives up. Like when he went to save Ringo despite being told to give up because she would die and he would die in attempting to save her and succeeded in doing so, and quickly reflected an enemy attack together with Ringo in extreme cold.
        Ikki states if you run you will hit a wall and if you fly you will get shot down. But even so if you give up it's the end and it's because of the height of the wall that he was able to grow strong enough to compete with Sora. And when Ringo says he must have driven crazy falling down again and again on the ground he states because of that he is at his strongest now when is standing up. And proudly states that there is no impossible in his or Ringo's dictionary.
        It has been said by Agito that Ikki can break any cage, made by anyone at anytime. Rika has once noted that Ikki is unpredictable and she can never really understand the logic behind his actions, however he is not like Sora who has logic behind his actions. She remarks that it's like he is building something new every second and with every second that piles up he is reborn anew.
        Sora speculated that before Ikki's eyes there exists infinite number of possibilities for the future.
