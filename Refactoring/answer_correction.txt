REFACTORING
For this assignment, you need to:
1.Figure out which line numbers from the original HTML file are determined by each bad practice. List your answers in a new text file “answers.txt”. 

1. Too much wrapping tag = line number 47 and 51
=> CORRECT!

2. Using inline css = line number 52
=> Line 52 is not an inline css. Inline css are known to be used as attribute in a tag. Look for line 55-66 "style" attribute in <label>.

3. Inappropriate naming = line number 48,49,52,67, and 68
=> CORRECT! Line 67 and 68 is too much generic name. 

4. Wrong indentation in css = line number 13, 17, and 20
=> You will notice that in css, there should be indentation for parent-child relationship of tags.
Ex. 
label {
  display:block;
}
  label input {
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    margin-right: 5px;
  }
You will find more of this in the rest of the code.


5. Not utilizing semantic tag = line number 44 and 46
=> CORRECT!

6. Repeated style = line number 26 and 33
=> CORRECT! 

7. Redundant display of a block element = line number 55 to 66
=> This can be true. But there is one more tag that has natural block display that still styled to be display:block. 
Let me know if you figured it now.

8. Using too many classes over and over again = line number 48, 49 and 52
=> CORRECT!

9. Using html tag that dictates style = line 16
=> Wrong. Refer to https://learn.village88.com/m/34/959/4760 Best Practice #7.
Once you figured it out now, remove it and make sure that the output in browser is same with expected output.

10. Styling an element using tag's attribute/s = line number 55 to 66
=> This can be true. However, there is one more html tag. 
Once you figured it out, remove it and make sure that the output in browser is same with expected output.

11. Unordered import of stylesheet = <line numbers>
=> Read about https://learn.village88.com/m/34/959/4756 Normalize css.
Once you figured its purpose, think of how will be the arrangement of import in your <head> tag. 
Should the normalize comes first before the style.css? or reverse?

12. Using Internal css = line number 4 to 39
=> CORRECT
